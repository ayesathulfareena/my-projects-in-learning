Once upon a time in a <place>, there was a <adjective> <creature> named <name>. <Name> loved to <verb> every day. One day, <name> discovered a <adjective> <object> in the middle of <place>. 

Curious, <name> decided to take the <object> to their <relative>, who was a <profession>. The <relative> said, "This <object> has the power to <superpower>! Use it wisely."

From that day forward, <name> became the most <adjective> <creature> in all of <place>. And they lived <adverb> ever after.
